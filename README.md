# FTP Server/Client Test Applications

## Purpose
This code was built in VS Code using .Net 6.0 as a learning effort to understand FTP at a lower level. It is by no means complete, but does provide some good tools to understand how to handle the server-side of an FTP connection while also providing a Client side for test and additional behavioral expectations.
